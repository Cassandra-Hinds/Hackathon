  <div>Prostheses are artificial parts that replace a missing part of the body. A prosthesis is designed to improve someone's quality of life by restoring a function or their appearance, and often both. Our prostestics devices will significantly improve the quality of life of amputees and people with congenital defects. We plan on using mind prosthesis to help people help them by controlling their body parts with their mind.
    The way our product works is...
    muscle memory helps the limbs and exoskelaton move
    headset recievces senory touch and sends it back to limb(s)</div>
