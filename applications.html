  <div class="mt-5">
    The Exodus Exosuit is a neurologically controlled exoskeleton that acts as a guide for your body.



    The exoskeleton conforms to the users body and adjusts to the users measurements. Using the neural interfaced headset that attaches to the spine of the exoskeleton, the user can control the exoskeleton with mere thoughts.
    
    
    
    Any movement that is possible with the human body is transmittable to the Exodus Exosuit. Our Exoskeleton was designed with the accessibility of paralyzed patients in mind. So we made sure that it was easy to use. It is very easy to learn the movements of the exoskeleton.
    
    
    
    Using the signals sent from the neurons in the brain, the exoskeleton moves according to what ever signals are sent. The brain signals are sent and recorded to the headsets neural interface and are transmitted to the exoskeleton.
    
    
    
    Say you are thinking of moving your right arm. Mere thoughts of moving your right arm are transmitted to the exoskeleton and the exoskeleton moves your arm for you.
    
    
    
    Want to move your fingers too? The exoskeleton will make sure you are able to give your teammates a thumbs up!
