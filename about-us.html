    <p>To let people who don't have or can't move their limbs the ability to walk, run, swim and more.</p>
    <P>But in a way that hasn't really been done before</P>
    <p>With normal prosethics it could take weeks, months or even a year to learn to walk with them. And along with that you lose the sense touch with in that arm.</p>
    <p>We're trying to the transition to a prothetic seemless. Instead of you learning how to use it, it learns how you want to use it. You'll back your sense of touch and it'll be like you have never lose your arm</p>
    <p>For those who have all their but are paralyzed in one way or the other we'll create exoskoton to allow them walk with as much ease as someone who isn't paralyzed</p>
